      "''[[Ethnologue]]'' identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps [[Shompen language|Shompen]], which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and [[Munda languages|Munda]]. However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and [[Khasi–Khmuic languages|Khasi–Khmuic]])<ref>Diffloth 2005</ref> while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.<ref>Sidwell 2009</ref>\n",

      "== Typology ==\n",
      "Regarding word structure, Austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic [[sesquisyllable|\"sesquisyllabic\"]] pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial, unstressed, reduced [[minor syllable]] followed by a stressed, full syllable.{{sfn|Alves|2014|p=524}} This reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original Proto-Austroasiatic prefixes, such as the causative prefix, ranging from CVC syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants.{{sfn|Alves|2014|p=526}} As for word formation, most Austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes, many have [[infix]]es, but suffixes are almost completely non-existent in most branches except Munda, and a few specialized exceptions in other Austroasiatic branches.<ref>Alves 2014, 2015</ref>\n",
      "\n",
      "The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of [[Register (phonology)|register]] contrast, either between [[modal voice|modal]] (normal) voice and [[breathy voice|breathy]] (lax) voice or between modal voice and [[creaky voice]].<ref>Diffloth, Gérard (1989). [http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/15:139-154.pdf \"Proto-Austroasiatic creaky voice.\"]</ref> Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, [[tonogenesis]]. Vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by Chinese that its original Austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of South Chinese languages, whereas Khmer, which had more influence from Sanskrit, has retained a more typically Austroasiatic structure.\n",

He show with his analysis that the homeland of Austroasiatic is somewhere near the [[Yangtze]]. He suggests the [[Sichuan Basin]] as likely homeland of proto-Austroasiatic before they migrated to other parts of central and southern China and than into Southeast Asia.

The lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum.
